# Minesweeper
## What is it?
This is a minesweeper clone made from winforms because I wanted to do something of the sort. 
### How to run?
1. Go to releases
2. Download the zip of the most recent release
3. Extract and run the exe file
4. If it asks if you want to run, click more options and run anyway. I dont know how to avoid this, because it works fine on my device
### Custom building
If for some reason the exe does not work, or you dont want to use it, you can open the .sln in Microsoft Visual Studio and use that to build, just click the start button. From there you have two options:
1. Play it from there
2. Navigate to the project directory, then locate the bin folder, Debug Folder, then run the executable.
    - You can always take it out of that directory to run it
    - Should not need admin priveleges, or it has been modified by someone other then me!
    - The zip file in releases contains all the files in that directory, I dont know which ones are actually required or not so I put them all, leave the dll in there at least!!!
## Others
### Why?
Simply because I wanted to make something like minesweeper for myself to enjoy
### ToDo

- ~~Make sure all 'sprites' are in the proper places~~ All the checks passed...
- Add in the right click funtion to show 1. Blank ( ) 2. Mine (\*) 3. Question Mark (?)
